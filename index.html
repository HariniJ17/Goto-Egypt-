        <p>Tutankhamun was buried in a tomb that was unusually small considering
          his status. His death may have occurred unexpectedly, before the completion of a grander royal tomb,
          causing his mummy to be buried in a tomb intended for someone else. This would preserve the
          observance
          of the customary 70 days between death and burial. His tomb was robbed at least twice in antiquity,
          but
          based on the items taken (including perishable oils and perfumes) and the evidence of restoration of
          the
          tomb after the intrusions, these robberies likely took place within several months at most of the
          initial burial.<br>

        <h2>Cats in religious practices</h2>In ancient Egypt, cats were represented in social and religious
        scenes dating as early as 1980 BC. Several ancient Egyptian deities were depicted and sculptured with
        cat-like heads such as Mafdet, Bastet and Sekhmet, representing justice, fertility, and power,
        respectively. The deity Mut was also depicted as a cat and in the company of a cat.
        Cats were praised for killing venomous snakes, rodents and birds that damaged crops, and protecting the
        Pharaoh since at least the First Dynasty of Egypt. Skeletal remains of cats were found among funerary
        goods dating to the 12th Dynasty.<br><br>

              be Egypt's first successful attempt at constructing a "true" smooth-sided pyramid. Local residents refer
              to the Red Pyramid as el-heram el-watwaat, meaning the Bat Pyramid.
              The Red Pyramid was not always red. It used to be cased with white Tura limestone, but only a few of these
              stones now remain at the pyramid's base, at the corner.

                <strong>The Great Pyramid Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid.</strong> It served as the tomb of
                pharaoh
                Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Built c.2600 BC, over a period of
                about 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only
                wonder that has remained largely intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex,
                which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis". It is situated at the
                northeastern end of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.

                Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the world's tallest human-made
                structure for more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed,
                which lowered the pyramid's height to the current 138.5 metres (454.4 ft); what is seen today is the
                underlying core structure

                The Egyptian Red Sea coast has been inhabited since antiquity, with the area of Hurghada being occupied
                since the 4th century, when the ancient settlement of Abu Shaar, located 20 km north
                of the modern city, was established. Originally founded as a Roman military fort for Ala Nova Maximiana
                unit between 309-311, it was transformed into a Christian community around 400. The Christians
                repurposed the fort into a church, leaving behind inscriptions, graffiti, and artifacts such as a
                5th-century papyrus and a tapestry with a cross. The settlement declined after either the Sasanian or
                Arab conquest of Egypt.

                led to its transformation from a fishing village into a major port and naval base for the Egyptian Navy.
                It was conquered by Israel during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and returned to Egypt in 1957. A United
                Nations peacekeeping force was stationed there until 1967 when it was ordered to leave by Egyptian
                President Gamal Abdel Nasser, a fact that precipitated the Six-Day War during which it was reoccupied by
                Israel. Sharm El Sheikh remained under Israeli control from 1967 until the Sinai Peninsula was returned
                back to Egypt in 1982, after the Egypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979 that was signed in Washington,

                <strong>The name Abu Simbel, or Abu Sunbul in Modern Standard Arabic, is itself a derivative of the
                  ancient place name Ipsambul.</strong>
                In the past, Abu Simbel was located on the west bank of the Nile between the first and second Cataracts
                of the Nile. Cataracts are rapids caused by boulders or rock sills; they were only passable with
                difficulty by Nile ship traffic, especially at baseflow. Today both cataracts near Aswan and Wadi Halfa
                are covered by Lake Nasser, which is named after Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egyptian president from 1954 to
                1970. At the time of Ramses II, the southern border of the realm of the Pharaohs was located near the
                two cataracts. The construction of the Abu Simbel temple compound there was meant to demonstrate the
                power and eternal supremacy of Egypt with respect to the tributary Nubia.
